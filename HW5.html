                <p style="font-size:20px; color:#092222; font-family: Century gothic, Serif;">- Spirited Away (Japanese: 千と千尋の神隠し, Hepburn: Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, lit.'Sen and Chihiro's Spiriting Away') is a 2001 Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a>, animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Tohokushinsha Film, and Mitsubishi and distributed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toho">Toho</a></p>

                <p style="font-size:20px; color:#092222; font-family: Century gothic, Serif;">- Spirited Away tells the story of Chihiro Ogino (Hiiragi), a ten-year-old girl who, while moving to a new neighbourhood, enters the world of Kami (spirits of Japanese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto">Shinto</a> folklore). After her parents are turned into pigs by the witch Yubaba, Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse to find a way to free herself and her parents and return to the human world.

                    <li><p style="font-size:25px; color:#092222; font-family: Century gothic, Serif;">Did you know? Chihiro was inspired by Miyazaki's friend's apathetic 10-year-old daughter.</p></li>
               
                <p style="font-size:20px; color:#092222; font-family: Century gothic, Serif;">- At the time, Miyazaki was retired and working on personal projects, but after an unexpected spark on inspiration, he began work on Spirited Away. The filmmaker takes a yearly sabbatical every summer, often visiting at a mountain cabin with friends and family. After observing his friend's sullen, apathetic 10-year-old daughter, he was inspired to create a character like Chihiro.</p></li>

                <ul>
                    <li><p style="font-size:25px; color:#092222; font-family: Century gothic, Serif;">“How do you feel about Chihiro?”</p></li>

                    <p style="font-size:20px; color:#092222; font-family: Century gothic, Serif;">- “I think this story is similar to that of a girl who comes to, for example, Ghibli, and says, "Let me work here." For us, Ghibli is a familiar place, but it would look like a labyrinth to a girl coming here for the first time, a scary place. There are a lot of grumpy people here. Joining an organization, finding your own place, and being recognized there requires a lot of effort. In many instances, you must use your own strength. But that's a matter of course, that's living in the world. So, I am making the film with the idea that it is the world, rather than bad guys or good guys. The scary woman, Yu-baaba, who looks like a bad guy in this film, is actually the manager of the bath house where the heroine works. She's having a hard time managing the bath house; she has many employees, a son, and her own desires, and she is suffering because of those things. So I don't intend to portray her as a simple villain.”</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p style="font-size:25px; color:#092222; font-family: Century gothic, Serif;">Names</p></li>

                    <p style="font-size:20px; color:#092222; font-family: Century gothic, Serif;">- In the fantastical realm of Spirited Away, the meaning behind names take on special significance, often alluding to the character's power. For instance, Chihiro Ogino (荻野 千尋) can be loosely translated as a <em>thousand searches</em>. In the film, Chihiro signs a binding contract with Yubaba, who removes several characters and shortens her name to Sen (千) which just means a <em>thousand</em>.
                        Yubaba (湯婆婆) translates as "bathhouse witch", which is an apt fit for her role as the Bathhouse boss, who controls characters by taking their names. Meanwhile, her sister's name, Zeniba (銭婆) translates as "money witch”. Boh (坊) means "baby" or little boy -- and you can also spot the character written on his costume -- and Kamajii (釜爺) means "boiler geezer". In Spirited Away: Film Of The Fantastic And Evolving Japanese Folk Symbols, Reider found influences from Ursula Le Guin's book, The Earthsea Quartet. "Throughout the quartet, names are critical as 'who knows a man's name, holds that man's life in his keeping'".</p>
