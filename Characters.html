            <h2>Top 3 Spirited Away Characters</h2>
        </header>

        <h3>1. Chiharu</h3>
        <p>- Did you know? Chihiro was inspired by Miyazaki's friend's apathetic 10-year-old daughter.</p>

        <p>- At the time, Miyazaki was retired and working on personal projects, but after an unexpected spark on inspiration, he began work on Spirited Away. The filmmaker takes a yearly sabbatical every summer, often visiting at a mountain cabin with friends and family. After observing his friend's sullen, apathetic 10-year-old daughter, he was inspired to create a character like Chihiro.
        </p>

        <p>- A gangly, ten-year-old human girl, heroine of the movie. At first Chihiro is sullen, whiny, and afraid, with an annoying voice and sulky face. After her name is changed to Sen, she becomes brave and self-sufficient enough to free herself and her parents from the spirit world. As Sen evolves, her voice becomes less grating and her expression lifts and glows. By the end of the movie, when she becomes Chihiro again, her features appear much more mature. She is notable for her lack of greed, her respect for her elders, and her kindness toward others. These qualities cause those she meets to respect, love, and help her.</p>

    <h4>2. Haku/White Dragon</h4>
        <p>- Nigihayami Kohakunushi (饒速水小白主, Nigihayami Kohakunushi, lit. "Master of the Swift Amber River"), referred throughout most of the film by the name Yubaba gives him: Haku (ハク, haku), is the deuteragonist in the 2001 animated film Spirited Away.</p>
        
        <p>- A mysterious, secretive boy of about sixteen who can take the form of a flying dragon. He works for Yubaba, doing rather underhanded deeds such as stealing magic from others, but also has his own agenda. Haku helps Chihiro find an inner strength to survive in the spirit world. Alternatively gruff and gentle, he recognizes Chihiro when he meets her. However, he doesn't remember why he knows her, nor does he remember why he can't leave the bathhouse. Later, we learn he is a river spirit who once saved Chihiro's life and that his real name is Kohaku River.</p>

    <h5>3. Yubaba</h5>
         <p>- Yubaba (湯婆婆, Yubāba), or Granny by Chihiro, is the proprietor of the Bathhouse and the main antagonist of the Japanese animated film Spirited Away. She is the identical younger twin sister of Zeniba and the mother of Boh. She has a harpy servant called Yu-Bird and has an apprentice by the name of Haku, and is the employer of maybe hundreds of other bathhouse workers.</p>
       
        <p>- A witch who runs the bathhouse and gives Chihiro a job. Yubaba is strict, greedy, and quick to anger, but she's also fair and a stickler for following the rules of the spirit world. She understands the power of identity and changes her workers' names as a means of control, such as when she changes Chihiro's name to Sen. Yubaba is perfectly groomed and heavily bejeweled, and her head is huge in proportion to her body. As befits her station in life, she lives in opulent rooms at the top of the bathhouse.</p>
